# Welcome to my Portfolio

My name is Lucas and I've started studying programming languages.

On this Github, you can find all of my projects, dating back to HTML and CSS.

to more advanced ones.

## Goal
My goal is to become proficient in many programming languages and use my abilities to 

bring the next generation of technology.

## My journey
So far, I've started college for software development and have already learned a lot.

But I plan to continue learning more for the next 2-4 years to reach the level of proficiency I want.

# Thank you for taking the time to read about me! 😁
